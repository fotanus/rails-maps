= RailsMaps

This project is not functional yet.

The idea of this project is to make easier for Rails development of small, well-defined, common tasks using maps. It uses leaflet as a backend, and will support the following functions:

* display of maps
* add markers
* show a popup when clicking in the marker
* Persistency for map positions
* form helper to select a position on the map and save.
